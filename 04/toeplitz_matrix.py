"""
You are given a square matrix of n x n size. Your task is to write a Python function that indicates whether the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix.

In a Toeplitz matrix, each descending diagonal (from left to right) is constant. That is, elements in each descending diagonal are the exact same.

For example, if the given matrix is:

Plain text
Copy to clipboard
6 7 8
4 6 7
1 4 6
Your function should return True because all diagonals from top-left to bottom-right are:

[1], [4, 4], [6, 6, 6], [7, 7], [8]
